A photo gallery JavaScript app built with Next.js 14, React, and Typescript. Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is based on https://github.com/timotgl/photostream, which is the same photo gallery but as a single page app with React/Redux/Typescript.

Hosted at https://timotgl-photostream.vercel.app.

## Questions and answers

### Why Next.js stack for such a simple app?

I'm using this project as a learning playground for frontend stuff. It works better for me to have an actual use case when doing that (hosting my own photos).
